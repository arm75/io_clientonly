INWORD/OUTWORD - FRONTEND - REACT/TS/TANSTACK-QUERY/SOCKET.IO

PLAY - <PlayPage/>

I. Not Your Turn
    1. Board - When it's not the player's turn, the source of the board, is Tanstack Query. Think of it like 'server state'.
    2. Cells - The source of the cells, is props. Each cell, will always get it's data, for display, or calculation, from the 
    'cell' prop. This might change, maybe. ... we'll see... lol.

II. Your Turn
    1. Board - When the player's turn starts, initially, the source of the board is again, Tanstack Query. However, every time
    Socket.io tells a client to refresh their queries (which happens after any player makes a valid play, and it completes on the 
    backend) the client makes a copy of the current board and stores it in a Jotai atom. Now when the player whose turn it is, decides 
    to click 'Make a Play', the source of the board is swapped, and becomes the copy made after the refresh event.
    2. Cells - Again, the source of the cells should be props.

III. Turn Machine - Stately XState state machine.

IV. Game Play Components - components which build out the game, all children of <PlayPage/>
    1. Layout - The Play page comnsists of a div covering the entire screen, with 2 divs inside of it, the Left and Right columns. The exact same size, 50-50.
    2. Left column
        a. Board - the board is in the Left column, but I am thinking of making it changable, to the right (swapping the left and right columns)
        b. Cells - the cells, are children of the board.
    3. Right column
        a. Top - Logo left, Menu right
        b. State Machine switch
